# MAS410 Project: Heave Compensator

*Project for MAS410 Hydraulic Components and Systems*

## Litterature

- The project uses the curriculum from the MAS410 course
- Also lecture 5 from MAS419 (under simscape folder in CWD)

## Teamwork/Source Control

- Since the project is not big enough to be worth proper source 
control with git, we chose to use **MATLAB drive**
- Since it is slow on some scrips and Simulink simulations, we
run and change the scrips locally and save them on the drive regularly
